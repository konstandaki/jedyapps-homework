Multimodule Compose App with OMDb & Ad SDK

A clean, scalable Android app built with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, coroutines, Retrofit+kotlinx.serialization, and Paging 3.
It uses a dedicated :sdk module to integrate AdMob (Native + Interstitial) behind provider-style interfaces so other networks can be added later.
